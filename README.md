## How to Use
The checklist makes use of specific notation to convey information regarding requisites and locations for checklist items.
- A relic icon at the end of a item indicates that the relic is required to access it except for two exceptions. First, if the Linen of Golden Thread icon appears along with another relic icon then it indicates an alternate access point by falling through an area of the map directly above the item's location. Secondly, the Incorrupt Hand of the Fraternal Master simply indicates that the item is hidden behind a fake wall or floor that can traversed by either attacking, dodging or falling from up high.
- A pair of square brackets [ ] indicates that a particular ability or prayer is required to access the item in question. First the nature of the of the obstacle is described followed by a colon and the suggested ability or prayer to use. In most cases it is not the only option available, instead any ability or prayer that has a similar reach will work.
- A pair of parenthesis ( ) indicate a required inventory item, NPC conversation, tool interaction, boss defeated, event trigger, or specific game mode. A combination of NPC name followed by a colon and inventory item indicates that an conversation with the NPC while possessing the item or having triggered the event indicated.
- A ( ! ) at the end of an entry indicates that it is missable if not done before continuing with the game
- A # after a questline name indicates that the entry is one of several steps required to complete it.
- A capital letter after a questline name indicates that the entry is one of several alternate questline steps.
- Indented sections indicate either a backtracking section (if it possesses a header title), an encounter with Candelaria (if it possesses "Candelaria's Flea Market" as a header title), or items in areas that are gated by the use of the relics required by the item immediately before the indented section (if it does not possess a header title).
